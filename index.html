								<h2 class="alt"> <strong>Tianhan Ling</strong>
								Portfolio</h2>
								<p>Greetings! I'm Tianhan Ling, currently pursuing my MSBA at the University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business. 
									Prior to this, I achieved a master's degree in data analytics from CMU, where I honed my skills in machine learning, 
									data visualization, and the management of extensive datasets. 
									Though I am technically proficient, I recognize the importance of melding these skills 
									with a strong business intuition and effective communication. 
									This motivated my decision to further my studies at USC. 
									As I gear up for Summer 2024, I am actively on the lookout for internship roles in data analysis or data science. 
									I'd be delighted to connect and discuss potential opportunities.

									In the subsequent sections of this portfolio, I will walk you through various projects that I've undertaken, 
									showcasing my capabilities and experiences.

								For this project, our team analyzed a survey dataset sourced from Kaggle, 
								leveraging insights into behavior and health conditions to gauge 
								the overall health status of individuals.
							</p>
							<p>
								Programming Language: Python
								Tool Kits: pandas, sklearn

							<p>In this endeavor, I embarked on a visualization project examining the correlation between 
								COVID-19 fatalities and vaccination rates. Utilizing visual tools such as line charts, 
								treemaps, and bar charts, I discerned patterns between deaths and vaccinations. 
								This analysis allowed me to identify trends across various countries and 
								make comparative evaluations of rates across continents.

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic_end.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I am Tianhan Ling, a graduate student in Business Analytics at the University of Southern California. 
								I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Irvine, majoring in 
								Mathematics and minoring in Statistics. This background equipped me with a solid foundation 
								in linear algebra and probability, preparing me for advanced data science studies. 
								While at CMU, I delved into exploratory data analysis, familiarized myself with various 
								machine learning models, and learned techniques for visualizing data and handling large datasets. 
								Currently, at the Marshall School of Business, I collaborate within a diverse, 
								cross-functional team, further enhancing my interpersonal and communication skills.
							</p>
							<p>With a background in biological imaging, I worked as a data analyst in a cross-functional team. 
								My colleague specialized in data mining, while another was a proficient full-stack engineer. 
								During my tenure, I honed my skills in Tableau, presenting findings biweekly, 
								which significantly improved my communication and presentation abilities. 

								Beyond this, my professional journey has spanned the insurance and advertising sectors. 
								These diverse experiences have equipped me with the agility to seamlessly integrate 
								into new teams and fostered my collaborative spirit. A notable accomplishment 
								was my involvement in setting up Publicis Groupe's advertising price database. 
								Collaborating with various advertising teams provided insights into diverse data formats 
								and crucial aspects of the advertising world. This comprehensive understanding enabled me to 
								efficiently organize and sort through over 10,000 data points in a mere three days.
							</p>
							<p>During my time at university, I primarily used Python and R for programming. 
								In both of my internships, Excel was an essential tool. 
								Furthermore, I took the initiative to learn SQL and Tableau on my own, 
								culminating in a visualization project that delved into the correlation 
								between COVID-19 fatalities and vaccination rates. 
								I believe these experiences and skills have equipped me well for future career endeavors.
